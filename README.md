**Development has stopped for BetterGaia 2. All future work will be focused on the [original BetterGaia](https://github.com/atthehotcorner/bettergaia).**

A rewrite of the exsisting BetterGaia browser extention, based off Xkit.

Change the way you experience Gaia Online. The only Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome extention that redesigns Gaia.
